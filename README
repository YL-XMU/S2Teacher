## 📖 Abstract

Although fully-supervised oriented object detection has made significant progress in remote sensing image understanding, it comes at the cost of labor-intensive annotation. Recent studies have explored weakly and semi-supervised learning to alleviate this burden. However, these methods overlook the difficulties posed by dense annotations in complex remote sensing scenes. 

In this work, we introduce a novel setting called **Sparsely Annotated Oriented Object Detection (SAOOD)**, where only partial instances are labeled, and propose **S$^2$Teacher** to address its challenges. Specifically, we tackle two key issues:

1. Sparse labeling leads to overfitting on limited foreground representations.
2. Unlabeled objects (false negatives) confuse feature learning.

Our **S$^2$Teacher** method:

- Uses **angle-consistency guidance** to progressively mine pseudo-labels for unlabeled objects from easy to hard, enhancing foreground representations.
- Reweights the loss of unlabeled objects to mitigate their impact during training.

Extensive experiments show that **S$^2$Teacher** significantly improves detector performance across different sparse annotation levels and achieves near fully-supervised performance on the DOTA dataset with only 10% of annotation instances, effectively balancing accuracy and labeling cost.

## ⚡ Key Features

- Supports sparsely annotated oriented object detection in remote sensing images.
- Progressive pseudo-label mining guided by angle-consistency.
- Loss reweighting for unlabeled objects to reduce confusion.
- Compatible with DOTA dataset and standard oriented object detectors.
- Achieves near fully-supervised performance with significantly fewer labels.
